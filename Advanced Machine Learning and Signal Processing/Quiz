4.Bayesian inference is a method of inference where the probability of a _________________ is updated as new evidence becomes available.
hypothesis
5. Why is the Gaussian distribution often used in machine learning?
- The process of sampling any random distribution with finite variance and adding the numbers together produces a Gaussian distribution (Central Limit Theorem)
- Occurs naturally in many situations (age, height of people, blood pressure readings etc.)
- It is easily described (you only need a mean and a variance)
- All of the above

1.Collect data
2.Calculate the likelihood
3.Obtain a posterior
4.Obtain a prior
4, 1, 2, 3

8.Naive Bayes is considered "naive" because
the input features are considered to be independent.

QUIZ: Testing, X-Validation, GridSearch

logarithmic , linear, cubic incorrect

QUIZ: Ensemble Learning
1. How are Random Forest different in re-sampling from Gradient Boosted Trees?
Sampling is done using Bootstrapping in RandomForests wheres Gradient Boosted Trees use Boosting

QUIZ: Regularization
1. Which regularization technique is penalizing large model parameters most?
L2 Regularization

kmeans
2. Which algorithm let's you visually determine a good number of clusters based on it's output?
hierarchical clustering

-1. What are the implications of using highly dimensional data?
Data becomes sparse as we add dimensions, 
Adding more dimensions reduces the collinearity in the data
-Adding more dimensions reduces the size of the data set,
Distances loose meaning in high dimensions
2. The process of reducing the number of random variables by obtaining a smaller set of artificial features is known as
feature reduction
3. What are some linear methods for dimensionality reduction?
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
4. Which line gives the direction of greatest variance in the data set plotted above?
red
5. We use _______________ to measure how a group of random variables vary together.
covariance
6.Using PCA to reduce the dimensionality of a data set involves the following steps:
1. Centre the data
2. Find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Sigma
3. Compute the covariance matrix
4. Select new dimensions and project the data
1, 3, 2, 4
7. In PCA, the second principal component is ______________ to the first principal component.
perpendicular
8. SystemML provides an out-of-the-box implementation of PCA.
True

QUIZ: Fourier Transform
1. The Fourier transform is an invertible transformation between the time and frequency domain representations of a signal.
Ture
2. 
3. The plot above shows a signal in the
time domain
4. The reduction of a continuous time signal to a discrete time signal is known as  
sampling
5. (graph plotted with a shape wave)
The sampling rate is too low
6. 
The frequencies of A and B are 3.0 and 5.0 Hz.
The amplitudes of A and B are 2.0 and 3.0
7. A known limitation of FT/DFT is that it requires an infinite series of sinusoids to represent a signal, so it cannot be used efficiently in a discrete setting.
False
8. Discrete Fourier Transform is slower compared to Fast Fourier Transform.
Correct. The computational complexity of DFT is O(n^2) in contrast to O(nlog(n)) for FFT.
