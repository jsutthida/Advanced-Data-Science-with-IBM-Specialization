# Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization

In this course, I learn about Fundamentals of Scalable Data Science, Advanced Machine Learning and Signal Processing, Applied AI with DeepLearning and Advanced Data Science Capstone. To finished the course I have to apply all knowledge for a real-world practical use case which I decided to do a Bank Customer Churn Prediction Using Spark ML project. 

I'm using dataset from Kaggle.com, try a different machine learning and deep learning algorithms to finding which algorithms gives the best performed. Since this is classification problem, I choose Logisitic Regression, Gradient Boost Tree and Feedforward Neaural Network by using Hyperparameter tuning and K-fold CrossValidation helps to find the optimal set of hyperparameters and traning with an unknown dataset for a model, creating a pipeline to composed of a sequence of linked steps that define the machine learning workflow. After building a model, Gradient Boost Tree has the best method to predict churn customer with 87% of accuracy score. Hence, deploying the model to Watson Machine Learning.

### Use Case and Business Requirements
- Build Model: Based on the historical bank customer data to create a Churn Prediction Model which provides prediction of customer/clients who most likely to cancle or leave the service with 87% or greater accuracy.

- Deploy Model: Deploying the model to Watson Machine Learning for the Model Evaluation.

### Overall Model Pipeline
1. Data cleaning
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature creation
4. Compare several machine learning models using hyperparameter tuning and CrossValidation
5. Make predictions and evaluate model performance
