# Advanced Data Science with IBM Specialization

In this course, I learn about Fundamentals of Scalable Data Science, Advanced Machine Learning and Signal Processing, Applied AI with DeepLearning and Advanced Data Science Capstone. To finished the course I have to apply all knowledge for a real-world practical use case which I decided to do a Bank Customer Churn Prediction Using Spark ML project. 

I'm using dataset from Kaggle.com, try a different machine learning and deep learning algorithms to finding which algorithms gives the best performed. Since this is classification problem, I choose Logisitic Regression, Gradient Boost Tree and Feedforward Neaural Network by using Hyperparameter tuning and K-fold CrossValidation helps to find the optimal set of hyperparameters and traning with an unknown dataset for a model, creating a pipeline to composed of a sequence of linked steps that define the machine learning workflow. After building a model, Gradient Boost Tree has the best method to predict churn customer with 87% of accuracy score. Hence, deploying the model to Watson Machine Learning.
